              The bestselling blockbusting story of how American Special Forces
              hunted down and assassinated the head of the world's biggest
              cocaine cartel. Killing Pablo charts the rise and spectacular fall
              of the Columbian drug lord, Pablo Escobar, the richest and most
              powerful criminal in history. The book exposes the massive illegal
              operation by covert US Special Forces and intelligence services to
              hunt down and assassinate Escobar.

              In 1914 a room full of German schoolboys, fresh-faced and
              idealistic, are goaded by their schoolmaster to troop off to the
              "glorious war". With the fire and patriotism of youth they sign
              up. What follows is the moving story of a young "unknown soldier"
              experiencing the horror and disillusionment of life in the
              trenches.

              Bilbo Baggins enjoys a quiet and contented life, with no desire to
              travel far from the comforts of home; then one day the wizard
              Gandalf and a band of dwarves arrive unexpectedly and enlist his
              services as a burglar on a dangerous expedition to raid the
              treasure-hoard of Smaug the dragon. Bilbo's life is never to be
              the same again.

              In The God Delusion, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator,
              God, almost certainly does not exist, and that belief in a
              personal god qualifies as a delusion, which he defines as a
              persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory
              evidence.
